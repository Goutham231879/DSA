1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram

A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.

Example 2:

Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= sentence.length <= 1000
    sentence consists of lowercase English letters.









what problem says 
problem says that given a string  return true if the sentence is a pangram or false if the sentence is not a pangram 

what is pangram ?
pangram is a sentence where every letter of the alphabet is present in the sentence at least once 



to solve this problem i have two approaches 

1 approach is 
using a temp array to store the present character in the array basically counting the characters in the string 

use a freq array and traversal thought the string and update the count of character in freq using this technique   ( ch-'a'  )

then count the freq array if the count is 26 then it is pangram else not a pangram 

tc - to traverse - O(n)
     to count - O(26)
      
sp - O(n) using a temp array to store the count or freq  of the characters in the string


2 approach 

using a method  called indexofchar

traverse  from a to z  and find the each character in the string if the corresponding character return -1 then there no exit pangaram return false;

else return true at end of the for loop it means that all characters are present in the string 

index of char how does this work it take a character as input and return the index of that character in the string if present it will return index else -1 which means it does not present in the stirng
